# Python Packet Sniffer

Welcome to the Python Packet Sniffer, a highly customizable and flawless tool for network analysis.

## Overview

Our Python Packet Sniffer is a superior tool in the realm of network analysis. It's built with a focus on customization and reliability, ensuring that it works flawlessly in various scenarios.

## Features

- **Highly Customizable**: The Python Packet Sniffer is designed to be flexible. You can easily adjust its settings to suit your specific needs, making it a versatile tool for any network analysis task.
- **Flawless Operation**: I've put a lot of effort into ensuring that this tool works perfectly under different conditions. It's been thoroughly tested and proven to perform without any issues.
- **Detailed Packet Information**: The sniffer provides detailed information about each packet, including the serial number, timestamp, protocol, packet length, destination MAC, source MAC, destination host, and source host.

## How to Use

- `sniffernewtry.py`: This is the main script that runs the packet sniffer. It binds to a specific network interface (whose IP you can provide in the variable interface IP) and listens for incoming packets, printing detailed information about each one.

Although you can also use the file `ethdata.py` to get a nice look at what's floating between the fiber cables that help you reach your favorite server.
